He spent time interacting with Proxi Farma, sampling their innovative nutrition products, and engaging with Green Pyramid (pictured), gaining first-hand insight into how CSR-backed equipment donations empower startups to translate lab-scale ideas into real-world solutions.\n\nFor many deep-tech startups addressing pressing social challenges, early access to well-equipped labs is the critical first step toward building technologies that can transform lives. It was invaluable for our CSR partner, Kemin Industries, to see how the equipment (moisture analyzer and CHNOS elemental analyzer) they have supported is actively enabling entrepreneurs to develop solutions for a more sustainable and nourished world.\n\nThank you, Kemin Industries , for your thoughtful and impactful CSR support!\n\nDr. SANTOSH VYAS Kemin Industries South Asia Pvt Ltd.
