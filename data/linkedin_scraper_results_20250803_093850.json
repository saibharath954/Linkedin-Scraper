But the essence is simple:\n\nGo back to the roots. \n\nPrioritise soil health, and productivity will naturally follow. Design farm equipment with farmers, for farmers—just like the village blacksmith who used to built with deep understanding and care. Build market linkages that serve their interest, not digital intermediaries. And most importantly, treat farmers as bankable entrepreneurs, not beneficiaries of charity. Real impact is not about disruption. It’s about trust, dignity, and lasting systems.\n\nThe smiles in this picture reflect the joy of reduced drudgery for women farmers. For them, this is impact: the simple dignity of easier work, saved time, and a little less burden on their shoulders.",

        "text": "Cut the Fat, Not the Flow\n\nThe development sector is drowning in intermediaries—re-granting agencies, consultants, collectives, and collaboratives.....Too often, they justify their existence with buzzwords like “systems change,” “capacity building,” “ecosystem,” and “platforms,” while delivering little beyond roundtables with the same faces in new venues, glossy reports where fonts change more than the data, flashy websites, feel-good videos (about themselves), feel-sad videos (about communities), and databases no one trusts.\n\nThe problem isn’t intermediation—it’s bad intermediation. When done well, intermediaries can aggregate demand, align incentives, allocate capital efficiently, and manage risk. But when they morph into self-reinforcing bureaucracies, they stall progress and drain resources, especially when led by people with no personal stake in the outcome. Low \"skin in the game\" means leaders enjoy asymmetric rewards without bearing consequences. They are insulated from failure, making them risk-averse and impact-light.\n\nWe need to rethink the chain. Funders must back proximate actors directly, invest in real capacity, and shift accountability from process to outcomes. The goal isn’t fewer intermediaries—it’s better ones. The best ones are entrepreneurs. They put their credibility, sweat, and future on the line.\nCommunities don’t need more gatekeepers. They need partners who deliver.",

        "text": "2 Founders. 2 Experts. One Topic = 2+2 Model!\n\nAt Deshpande Startups, we’re rethinking how meaningful founder conversations should happen. Most traditional formats—such as panels or one-on-ones—tend to fall short. They're either too surface-level or disconnected from the realities of building in Bharat.\n\nThat’s why we introduced the 2+2 model:\n • 2 early-stage founders\n • 2 seasoned experts\nOne open, unscripted conversation—where ideas collide, perspectives challenge, and learning flows both ways.\n\nWe put this model into action with our first session on “Enabling Founders Beyond Metros – The ONDC Opportunity,” Moderated by Rashmi Joshi\n\nAs ONDC opens new pathways for inclusive digital commerce, we explored what it truly takes to enable founders building from beyond Tier 1 cities.\n\nExperts: Nandita Sharma & Sachin Korla\nFounders: Basanth Verma  & Manjunath Gogi\n\nWhat it unlocks:\nThis initiative builds trust by fostering safe, direct conversations without posturing. It brings together experts from diverse fields like policy, design, and commerce to tackle challenges beyond a single product. This curation of different perspectives challenges assumptions, revealing that issues often stem from cultural or trust barriers rather than tech problems.\n\nBig thanks to all four speakers and special appreciation to Nandita Sharma for her ONDC-wide insights that brought structure and momentum.\n\nMore 2+2 sessions coming soon!\n\nRashmi Joshi | Manish Jaiswal",
